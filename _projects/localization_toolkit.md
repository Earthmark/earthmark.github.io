The tool is localized using itself, change your language between Japanese Korean, or English to see it in action!

Examples: See the [Earthenworks locale files](https://github.com/Earthmark/Earthenworks-Translations).

Translations are loaded and saved in a format roughly compatible with the [Resonite locale files](https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Locale), pluralizers are **not** supported.

An example of how an avatar could be sold from inside the platform, using an external POS integration for purchase validation.

**Status:** Cancelled due to not finding a viable world for the saloon. The proof of concept was completed successfully.
{: .notice}

Links to the project can not be provided as it's currently a spawned item, cleaning up the item is non trivial, and protecting item assets is less robust than a worlds.

The kiosk lets users who have purchased the avatar to customize and spawn an already set up and protected version of the Coyote Mk.2 by Alber, as well as let the user spawn out an example version to try the avatar out before purchasing.

The authentication mechanism was provided via the Gumroad key API, and routed users to the website to complete their purchase if they didn't have an existing key. 

The kiosk could also be configured to have the avatar show itself off, including pre-recorded voice lines that route through the viseme driver, as well as full body animations (both via in-platform mocap and recording utilities).

The end goal was to make a saloon where different pre configured coyotes milling about that would look at and talk to the user. The user could equip one they liked or use a kiosk to fully customize the avatar.

The kiosk also included flat-panel LOD versions provided using the normal-reactive 2D image technique by RedDragon.

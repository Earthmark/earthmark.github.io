title: "User Made Tutorial World"

The tutorial was a testing ground for learning what would increase retention of information, and what would make users feel more connected to the platform. 

**Status:** Deprecated as Resonite has a pretty good tutorial experience, and many of the examples are out of date.

The world was built over about 8 months in public sessions. New users would join randomly during development, and their experiences and feedback were integrated directly into the world. 

Each of the sections of the world can be moved freely, and the entire world was built as a collaborative effort from dozens of users who stopped by and had good ideas. The dashboard room is one good example of this, where the lighting and visual effects were largely made by different users.
